    It's time for another round of the presidential debate bingo! The game where you play along as Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump share the stage for the first time as they compete for the White House this November.

The 90-minute debate is scheduled to begin at 9 p.m. ET Tuesday and will air on ABC and stream on ABC News Live, Disney+ and Hulu, according to ABC. USA TODAY will also stream The ABC News Presidential Debate Simulcast on the USA TODAY channel available on most smart televisions and devices. 

The debate, moderated by David Muir and Linsey Davis of ABC, will be critical for both candidates in winning support from swing voters as the race remains narrow. A poor performance from either nominee could create echoes of President Joe Biden's outing when he faced Trump in June, which was the first major domino that led to Biden dropping out of the race and endorsing Harris.

Like the previous debate, Tuesday's event wil not feature a live audience and there will be no opening statements from the two candidates, who will be introduced by the moderators. The debate will have two commercial breaks, but campaign staff will not be allowed to interact with the candidates during that time. Candidates' microphones will also remain muted throughout the debate except when it is their turn to speak.
